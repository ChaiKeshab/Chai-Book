Tags needs reconfigurations on how it works. 
tags need to be array instead of string
    - each input string will be an element of the array
    - this allows to add multiple tags to a content

// Select all notes, select specific note.

- on select, a new navbar appears on top of current
- input the selected note in an array
- note will contain the entire info related to selected note which will be used to perform all existing functionality at once.
- a close button on navbar clears the array and closes the navbar returnig everything to initial state.


current idea for execution  
- the new navbar will be the children of Note.jsx and all the functionality will be passed as props

## functionality to be passed
- delete note
- add label // execute through edit notes. 
    - add label on every existing notes without the selected label
    - if every note already has the selected label, it should remove the label on re-select
- pin notes

New add tag method

- tags are stored as strings in array. (initially array: empty)
- option to add tag. onClick() => input-field to create tag, show all existing tags.
- on creating new tag, add the tag to the selected note, on list, and on left nav.
